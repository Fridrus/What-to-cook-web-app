# What-to-cook-web-app

In the process of learning html, I've realized that github is not the ideal environment to write and test html.
As a result, I've moved to coding in Acode for android, and testing in chrome.
I've also learned that watching lessons and taking thoughrough notes is not an efficient way to learn coding (thanks Tina Huang https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EzmbCuoFcU).
