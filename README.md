# What-to-cook-web-app

In the process of learning html, I've realized that github is not the ideal environment to write and test html.
As a result, I've moved to coding in Acode for android, and testing in chrome.
I've also learned that watching lessons and taking thoughrough notes is not an efficient way to learn coding (thanks Tina Huang https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EzmbCuoFcU).
I will be periodically iterating onto this repositry and working on the web app in my coding environment.
my goal for this web app is to generate a google search by choosing a selection of keywords to find recipes based on preferances or accessible ingredients.
As of the first itteration of this repository, I am half-way through the https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css course.

I have completed the intro to css coursework. The app looks much nicer, but it could still use a bit of refinement.

The next course is visual design. Hopefully this will help me design an app that is visually pleasing and accessible.
